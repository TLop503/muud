# MuddiJson Documentation

## Introduction

MuudiJson is used as a go-between, markup language agnostic handler for converting markup languages to other markup languages. It is designed to only be used within this project, and is not supported by any file renderers or other systems. You could write muudiJson manually, but it is not recommended.
