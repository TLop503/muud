# M.U.U.D. (MarkUpUpDownDown)

M.U.U.D. is (going to be) a Python package for converting all the markup languages to all the other markup languages.

Currently Suported:
- Nothing

Planned Support:
- ReStructuredText
- Markdown
- HTML
- JSON? (probably not)
- YAML?

### These are extremely subject to change. 

## Work so Far:
Note that unless a release has been published these are untested
